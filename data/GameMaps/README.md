To convert TQ's `.dmaps` into compressed maps `.cmap` for the server's use, place the
contents of the client's map folder inside this folder.
The contents of the folder should include the map and scene folders.

Also don't forget to copy the `GameMap.dat` from `ini` folder here too, it will be used to construct the maps into the database.

After being converted, the `.dmap` files and scene files from this folder, they can be
removed.
